This is where Ashley enjoys adding software competencies to her skill set.

Hello!

My name is Ashley Nance and my spirit animal is either an elephant or a blue whale, depending on the day. It should be no surprise my favorite colors are blue and green. I'm excited to be learning new skills that will help me be successful and help more people!
